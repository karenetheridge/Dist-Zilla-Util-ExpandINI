NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Util::ExpandINI - Read an INI file and expand bundles as
    you go.

VERSION
    version 0.001001

SYNOPSIS
      # Write a dist.ini with a bundle anywhere you like
      my $string = <<"EOF";
      name = Foo
      version = 1.000

      [@Some::Author]
      EOF;

      path('dist.ini.meta')->spew( $string );

      # Generate a copy with bundles inlined.
      use Dist::Zilla::Util::ExpandINI;
      Dist::Zilla::Util::ExpandINI->filter_file( 'dist.ini.meta' => 'dist.ini' );
      # Hurrah, dist.ini has all the things!

DESCRIPTION
    This module builds upon the previous work ":Util::BundleInfo" ( Which
    can extract configuration from a bundle in a manner similar to how
    "dzil" does it ) and integrates it with some *very* minimal "INI"
    handling to provide a tool capable of generating bundle-free "dist.ini"
    files from bundle-using "dist.ini" files!

    At present its very naÃ¯ve and only keeps semantic ordering, and I've
    probably gotten something wrong due to cutting the complexity of
    Config::MVP out of the loop.

    But at this stage, bundles are the *only* thing modified in transit.

    Every thing else is practically a token-level copy-paste.

METHODS
  "filter_file"
                                               #  $source   , $dest
      Dist::Zilla::Util::ExpandINI->filter_file('source.ini','target.ini');

    Reads $source, performs expansions, and emits $dest

  "filter_handle"
      Dist::Zilla::Util::ExpandINI->filter_handle($reader,$writer);

    Reads $reader, performs expansions, and emits to $writer

  "filter_string"
      my $return = Dist::Zilla::Util::ExpandINI->filter_string($source);

    Decodes $source, performs expansions, and returns expanded source.
