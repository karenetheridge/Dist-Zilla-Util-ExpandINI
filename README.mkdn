# NAME

Dist::Zilla::Util::ExpandINI - Read an INI file and expand bundles as you go.

# VERSION

version 0.001000

# SYNOPSIS

    # Write a dist.ini with a bundle anywhere you like
    my $string = <<"EOF";
    name = Foo
    version = 1.000

    [@Some::Author]
    EOF;

    path('dist.ini.meta')->spew( $string );

    # Generate a copy with bundles inlined.
    use Dist::Zilla::Util::ExpandINI;
    Dist::Zilla::Util::ExpandINI->filter_file( 'dist.ini.meta' => 'dist.ini' );
    # Hurrah, dist.ini has all the things!

# DESCRIPTION

This module builds upon the previous work [`:Util::BundleInfo`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Util::BundleInfo) ( Which can extract configuration from a bundle in a manner similar to how dzil does it ) and integrates it with some _very_ minimal `INI` handling to provide a tool capable of generting bundle-free `dist.ini` files from bundle-using `dist.ini` files!

At present its very na√Øve and only keeps semantic ordering, and I've probably gotten something wrong due to cutting the complexity of Config::MVP out of the loop.

But at this stage, bundles are the _only_ thing modified in transit.

Every thing else is practically a token-level copy-paste.
